Omnibot receiver libraries
##########################

For a more framework-like experience, omnibot has receiver libraries for routing events received via handler callbacks.

If you're writing your bot in python, we have a library that makes receiving messages simple. The omnibot-receiver library lets you route messages to functions using decorators in a style like Flask, and will auto-generate help documentation for your routes. See `the omnibot-receiver library docs <https://github.com/lyft/python-omnibot-receiver>`_ for more info.
